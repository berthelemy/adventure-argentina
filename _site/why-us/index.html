								  <h2 id="we-want-to-give-you-more-than-a-holiday">We want to give you more than a holiday</h2>

<p>Our desire is to give you an experience that will stay with you for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Our holidays offer lots of opportunity to meet local people. We always try to invite a few local friends to share our walks. This will give anyone coming with us the wonderful opportunity to <em>really</em> experience Argentina. You never know, you may just make some life long friends, as we did.</p>

<p>Where else could you experience one of the worlds greatest cities, one of the highest mountain ranges on the planet, the worlds largest waterfall, the greatest barbeque (yes, we can cater for vegetarians) all in one amazing holiday, and, led by  a caring, knowledgeable and experienced guide?</p>

<h2 id="we-are-not-just-tour-guides">We are not just tour guides</h2>

<p>We live in Jujuy and know the people and the places personally.</p>

<p>Lee has 25 years experience of Argentina. He has an Argentinian wife and speaks fluent Spanish. His time is divided between Britain and Argentina. His house and even his pet cat are in Argentina, so he is well qualified to guide your dream holiday in this wonderful land.</p>

<p>It is difficult to find any good maps of the area. Lee has learned the mountains and the paths from living there. You can be sure to see things that other companies won’t know about.</p>

<p>For us, at Adventure Argentina, the personal touch is very important and is everything that we are about.</p>

<h2 id="your-security-and-enjoyment-are-our-highest-priority">Your security and enjoyment are our highest priority</h2>

<p>We believe that security is extremely important. This doesn’t mean that Argentina is any more dangerous than Britain but, the more secure you feel, the more you will relax and enjoy your experience. From landing in Buenos Aires to leaving Buenos Aires at the end of your holiday you will be looked after very well.</p>

<p>Whilst on the walks you will feel safe in the knowledge that you are being guided by an English speaking, qualified mountain leader.</p>

<p>We won’t be taking you anywhere we have not been before.</p>

<h2 id="we-want-to-change-local-lives-for-the-better">We want to change local lives for the better</h2>

<p>Investment is the word. We aim to invest in local people. We pledge to dedicate a percentage of the profits from every guided holiday to helping a local cause or to give a local person the opportunity that they wouldn’t have otherwise have had.</p>
