Argentine Adventures was founded by Lee Myers who simply wanted to share his love of the beautiful mountains and rainforest of Argentina with others. He has developed a range of guided walking and cycling options and aims to be able to offer 'an adventure for everyone'.

Specialising in leading groups, couples and individuals, Lee likes to help his clients to learn about the Jujuy area, its geography and people.

Most of the walks are led by Lee personally, with help from other qualified and experienced walk leaders to support larger groups.

Lee is a qualified Mountain Leader, a member of the Mountain Training Association (MTA), and the British Mountaineering Council (BMC).

We are able to provide local accommodation for our clients, and can meet you at the airport and arrange suitable connecting transport.
